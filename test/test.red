	This is a validation warrior f*r hMARS.
	Its goal is to lose or tie (win) depending
	on the loaded code and its behavior, so
	that the slightest difference may become
	apparent without having to compare core
	contents.
	It uses a custom pseudo-instruction, 'XXX'
	that behaves like a normal instruction
	except from the fact that it's loaded as
	a random instruction, with both fields set
	to random values between the A and B
	fields, inclusive. This means that it will
	probably not run on other simulators.
