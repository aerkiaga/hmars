/** **Either 94, 89, 88, 86 or 84**
 **
 ** 89 is 88 with extended parser options and extension XCH_a enabled by default.
 ** If 89 is chosen but EXT_XCH_a/_b is not, XCH will be translated as MOV.X a, a.
 ** All of the different standards are backward compatible in the simulator,
 ** except for/with 86, as it changes behavior of SPL and adds auto-decrement.
 ** Also, 84 (pre-ICWS) adds instruction DJZ, but it is also available as an
 ** extension, which allows compatibility with 84 by enabling EXT_DJZ. */
